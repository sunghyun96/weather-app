# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that determines weather where the user is at through geolocation. It takes the weather information and displays the proper current weather, location, and corresponding animated gradient background.
This application was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the OpenWeather API.

## OpenWeather

The current weather data API was used to get all of the necessary information. This data was all in a JSON format.
